This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that when you try to retrieve a value that doesn't exist, instead of getting `null` or `undefined`, you get a stringified `null`, which can lead to unexpected behavior in your application. This is particularly problematic when you're checking for null values using strict equality (`===`).
